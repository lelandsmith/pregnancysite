You must be thinking why am I suddenly talking about option to freeze eggs. 

The first thought had come to my mind when i was struggling to get pregnant and was going through failed IVF cycles only to understand that the health of the egg is extremely important for it to successfully implant to the uterus. And unfortunately, it starts decreasing in the females after 35 years of age and is very poor after you have crossed 40 (Read my blog "Is it too early to start planning for kids?" to understand how to find the health of the egg). At that time I used to think if only there was someone to suggest when I was younger about this option.

I again thought about this when recently, I was discussing with my husband about a friend who has a condition of PCOD where your periods are irregular to extent that Aunt flo might not visit you for months altogether. In that case your chances of getting pregnant reduces further down. She's 34+ years of age, still single and her mom had her menopause at the age of 38.

And suddenly I had the urge to write this blog down. I would like to give her a shoutout and tell her "GO, FREEZE YOUR EGGS". This is the best option that you have. 

Well, no matter how I'm surely gonna suggest her this option. But would like each one of you also to consider this if you are going through one of these situations. So whenever you decide to get married and have kids you'll have the option to use your eggs and give birth to a healthy baby.

My best wishes to each one of you!!
