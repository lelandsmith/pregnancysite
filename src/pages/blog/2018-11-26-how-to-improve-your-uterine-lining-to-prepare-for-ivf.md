The thickness of this lining is very important for women undergoing IVF. The doctor will measure the thickness of the lining before the embryo transfer, to ensure that it is sufficiently thick to allow for implantation. A thick, receptive, nourishing uterine lining is the best possible environment for the embryo, and the ideal lining is at least 7 to 8mm thick and displays a “trilaminar” (or “three layered”) appearance on an ultrasound.

When I started this journey, I was struggling with thin endometrium. Infact, during the first cycle I didn't even know the importance of the thickness of uterine lining. Because of thin endometrium my doctor was considering frozen embryo transfer which has better chance of implantation. I went through three cycles of trying to increase the thickness but it won't go up beyond 6.5 mm. My doctor then decided to still go through with the transfer saying "sometimes" it works with thin endometrium. I transferred very good quality my precious 3 embryo's. But 6.5 mm thickness is too less for it to implant. DO NOT go for transfer if your lining is not more than 7 mm at the very least.

This was my 1st failed transfer and the reality basically struck me and I started researching about this on the internet. I would have tried every possible thing to increase the thickness of my lining which I'm gonna list down below. On good cycles my thickness reached about 8.9 mm but yes this doesn't happen in every cycle. In any case, I do believe doing following routines did help a bit in increasing the thickness and there's no harm in trying these.

Here's a list of all that I tried to increase the endometrium thickness

1. **Acupuncture**: I decided to change my doctor when i read up on importance of endometrium thickness and that with 6.5 mm I had 1 in a million chance to conceive. And I stumbled upon articles which mentioned acupuncture does help in increasing the blood circulation and thus may have indirect impact on the lining. I started looking for places which were into acupuncture. The doctor I went to next was so blunt about my chances of conceiving due to my age that I was almost in tears. But due to this quality of his I decided to get treatment from there. He said he'll observe me for one cycle before committing to giving me any treatment and all he started me with that was acupuncture and asked me to start meditation. And here I was in my first cycle with him (observation cycle) with almost touching 7.5 mm endometrium thickness.
