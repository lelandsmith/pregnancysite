On July 20th 2018, I took pregnancy test and here it was looking at me a solid, thick BFP (Big Fat Positive). Me and my husband were waiting for this moment for almost two and half year when we started our IVF journey and after 4 unsuccessful transfers our prayers were answered. Both of us overjoyed cried as this was only a home pregnancy test and we were yet to pass the bHCG test. The moment we had our positive bHCG test, we decided we need to put down everything we did in this cycle. 



I'm not sure if all my theories and experiments actually worked but I guess there's no harm in doing anything that can give us that positive mind frame which is utmost important.



1. **Keep your feet warm**. It's said in Chinese medicine that your feet are connected with your womb and if you feet are warm your womb will be warm. I'm sure you'll want to keep your embryo's warm enough. I came across this tip luckily just couple of days before my transfer in this cycle and started wearing socks all day and night long throughout the two week wait period and only took it out while having bath. You can continue wearing it as long as you think is comfortable.



2. **Eat Pineapple Core**: Somehow in my mind I have a feeling this worked wonders for me. There's nothing to prove this theory and it's just a big gut feel that I have. Luckily enough I read about this too just couple of days before my transfer in this cycle. 

They say that pineapple is an implantation aid, and the rule of thumb after an embryo transfer is to cut the pineapple into 5 pieces, and eat a piece of pineapple, including the core, for five days, counting transfer day as Day 1.

So what is it about pineapple that makes it so special? Apparently, there are indications that the bromelain in pineapple increases cervical mucous. This increase in cervical mucous can make the uterus “stickier,” which can lead to increased rates of implantation. Most of the bromelain in the pineapple is found in the core, so it is important to eat that part along with the meat.



3. **Acupuncture**:
